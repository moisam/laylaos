/* The following type indicates the definition of a symbol as being
   an indirect reference to another symbol.  The other symbol
   appears as an undefined reference, immediately following this symbol.

   Indirection is asymmetrical.  The other symbol's value will be used
   to satisfy requests for the indirect symbol, but not vice versa.
   If the other symbol does not have a definition, libraries will
   be searched to find a definition.  */

   Space is allocated for the set in the text section, and each set
   element's value is stored into one word of the space.
   The first word of the space is the length of the set (number of elements).

   The address of the set is made into an N_SETV symbol
   whose name is the same as the name of the set.
   This symbol acts like a N_DATA global symbol
